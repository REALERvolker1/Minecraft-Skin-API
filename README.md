# Minecraft-Skin-API

I made this for my discord bot really, it was just for testing things. Also I figured out Koa too so that was cool ig. I learned things and stuff.

# Usage

run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/REALERvolker1/Minecraft-Skin-API
cd Minecraft-Skin-API
npm install
node .
```

The URL format is:

http://localhost:3000/?skin=volker1

`http://[your-host-and-port]/?skin=[Minecraft-username]&json=[true if you want json output, can be ommitted]`

This does depend on an external site for the render. You may replace it with an alternative if it ever goes down. https://visage.surgeplay.com/index.html
